# MOTOR_MONITORING
A system that monitors motor vibrations in accordance with ISO 10816 standards and alerts the user when vibration levels exceed safety limits.
# INTRODUCTION
Industrial motors play a critical role in various applications, from manufacturing plants to power generation. Ensuring their safe operation is vital to prevent failures, downtime, and hazards. Our system monitors the vibration of a motor, providing real-time alerts if the motor exceeds its safety operating limits. Using a VSD Squadron microcontroller, SW420 vibration sensor, and an LCD for display, this system ensures proactive maintenance and enhances motor lifespan.
